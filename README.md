# An Escaping Model And Its Simulation
This is a teamwork for COMAP's Interdisciplinary Contest in Modelling. My teammates are S. Tan and Y. Du.

My major contributions are:

1. Modelling people's escaping behavior in the buildings.

2. Inspired by the method of celluar automata, I developed a program to simulate people's escaping process from the ground floor of the Louvre Museum.

Here is the result of my simulation:(temporarily unavailable)

"Elementary.nb" simulates people's escaping process from a room with 2 exits.

"Floor.nb" simulates people's escaping process from the ground floor of the Louvre Museum.
